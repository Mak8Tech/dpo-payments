### 📦 **Package Installation:**

```bash
# 1. Install package
composer require mak8tech/dpo-payments

# 2. Publish configuration
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mak8Tech\DpoPayments\DpoPaymentServiceProvider"

# 3. Configure .env
DPO_COMPANY_TOKEN=your-token
DPO_TEST_MODE=true
DPO_DEFAULT_COUNTRY=ZM

# 4. Run migrations
php artisan migrate
```

### 🚀 **Quick Usage Example:**

```php
// Create a payment
$transaction = DpoPayment::createPayment([
    'amount' => 100.00,
    'currency' => 'ZMW',
    'country' => 'ZM',
    'customer_email' => 'customer@example.com',
    'description' => 'Purchase'
]);

// Redirect to payment
return redirect($transaction->payment_url);
```

### 📱 **React/Next.js Integration:**

```jsx
import { DpoPaymentForm } from "@/components/dpo";

<DpoPaymentForm
  amount={100.0}
  defaultCountry="ZM"
  onSuccess={(data) => (window.location.href = data.payment_url)}
/>;
```

### 🔧 **Testing & Monitoring:**

```bash
# Check DPO status
php artisan dpo:status

# Process subscriptions
php artisan dpo:status --process-subscriptions

# Run tests
composer test
```

The package is production-ready with:

- Comprehensive error handling
- Transaction logging
- Webhook security
- Multi-currency support
- Mobile money integration
- Full refund capabilities
- Subscription lifecycle management

This implementation provides a complete, enterprise-grade payment solution for African markets through DPO, with special focus on Zambia while maintaining flexibility for other countries. The package follows Laravel 12 best practices and includes modern React components for seamless frontend integration.
